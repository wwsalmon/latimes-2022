                <p>In April 2022, OpenNews published an open letter to the Pulitzer Prize board, calling for the prize to play a bigger part in pushing for diversity in the news industry, in which <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/11/02/newsroom-employees-are-less-diverse-than-u-s-workers-overall/">77% of newsroom workers</a> are still non-Hispanic white.</p>
                <p>That got the Asian American Journalists Association Voices program investigative team thinking: what does diversity look like on the prize boards themselves?</p>
                <p>We were shocked to find that, <b>in its 104-year history, the Pulitzer Prizes has only had one Asian American voting judge</b> â€” who wasn't appointed until 2020.</p>
                <p>We embarked on two months of tireless outreach to collect a first-of-its-kind dataset on the racial and ethnic identities of top prize judges, as well as conducting in-depth interviews with news leaders and prize administrators.</p>

                <p>I <a href="https://github.com/wwsalmon/aaja-voices-scraping">created a web scraper</a> to get initial data across four prize boards. I handled outreach and interviews for the Livingston Awards, and <b>created all interactive graphics</b> in the final piece.</p>

                <p>The final piece was <a href="https://objectivejournalism.org/2022/08/journalism-awards-lack-diverse-judges/">republished by <b>The Objective</b>.</a></p>
